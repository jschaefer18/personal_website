        <h4 class = "subtitle">Introduction</h4>
        <p>
          My name is Josh Schaefer, and I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Brigham Young University-Idaho. 
          Ever since I was young, I've been fascinated by computers and technology. This passion led me to choose Computer Science
          as my field of study, where I've been able to explore programming, algorithms, and software development. 
          Being a student here has allowed me to learn from professors who worked in the technology field. 
          Hearing from their experiences has not only taught me but inspired me to also pursue a career in the technology field.
        </p>
  
        <h4 class = "subtitle">Where I Want to Be</h4>
        <p>
        After I graduate, I hope to become a successful software engineer. The company that I would be working at would be a company I believe in. 
        I would be working with a team and solving real world problems daily. I would strive to solve complex problems within the company and do my best work. 
        I also would be doing studies on the industry in my own time. This would allow me to keep up with market trends and be the best contributor to the company possible.
        </p>
        <h4 class = "subtitle">Passions and Interests</h4>
        <p>Not including technology I am also passionate about a lot of other things. An example is traveling. 
          I enjoy visiting new places, experiencing different cultures, food, music, etc. I think it would be amazing to combine my passion for technology with traveling. 
          This could be through a website or even an app. I hope in the future to take some of my passions and put them into projects.
