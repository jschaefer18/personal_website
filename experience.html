          <p class = "subtitle">
            I have programmed in several different languages throughout my time in highschool and college. My personal favorite is Python. 
            Since Python is so simple it really helped me to start thinking like a programmer. I was able to take what I learned from Python and apply it to other languages which made the learning process a lot easier.
            I also have experience in object oriented languages like C# and Java. I have recently started working on web development and am learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
            Knowing all of these different programming languages allows me to work on many different kinds of projects.

          <h4 class = "title">Database/Data Science</h4>
          <p class = "subtitle">
            In my first year of college I took an interest in the data science and databases section of a computer science degree. This led me to take an introduction to databases where I learned my MySQL and how to build a proper database. 
            After taking this class I decided to take Data Science Programming. In this class I learned many things like how to find specific data in a large dataset and display it, how to cleanse missing data, and even a little bit of machine learning. 
            This was all so cool to experience seeing the power of data and how it can be applied to real world problems. I think that going into the data science or database industry could be a very high possibility in the future.
