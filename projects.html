      <p>These are all the projects that I have completed throughout my first year at the University of Brigham Young-Idaho. By doing these projects I was able to learn so much in such a short amount of time.
         My Python projects consist of assignments from Intro to Programming and Programming with Functions. My final project in Programming with Functions is a NBA stats analysis software. This software allowed you to take the entire set of data from the NBA and display it for the user in a specified way. 
         In Data Science Programming I also created a portfolio that showed off many of the projects that I worked on. If you are interested in any of these projects feel free to take a look.
